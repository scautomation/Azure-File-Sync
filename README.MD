Azure File Sync Workbook

The workbook has three parameters, StorageSync, TimeRange and Workspaces. The workbook also pulls together the Storage Sync service with metrics and the Windows Event Logs we're collecting. The metrics contain heat map and line charts, I just haven't synched anything in a while.
